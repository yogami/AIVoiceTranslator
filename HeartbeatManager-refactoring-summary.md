# HeartbeatManager Refactoring Summary

## What We Accomplished

We successfully extracted the heartbeat functionality from the WebSocketServer class into a standalone HeartbeatManager component:

- Created a focused class with a single responsibility (maintaining connection health)
- Added comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
- Maintained interface compatibility with the original implementation
- Implemented clean error handling

## Key Insights Gained

1. **Small, Focused Extraction**: By targeting just the heartbeat logic, we were able to create a clean component with clear boundaries.

2. **Test-First Approach**: Writing tests before fully integrating the component helped ensure its behavior matched expectations.

3. **Integration Challenges**: We encountered issues when trying to replace the original functionality, highlighting the tight coupling in the original design.

## Next Steps

Based on our experience with the HeartbeatManager extraction, we should:

1. Continue with smaller, incremental extractions rather than attempting to refactor the entire WebSocketServer at once

2. Focus next on either:
   - WebSocketClientManager (to manage client state)
   - MessageRouter (to handle message routing and processing)

3. Address the failing tests related to translation and TTS functionality by:
   - Writing more comprehensive mocks for the translation services
   - Improving error handling in the existing implementation

## Test Coverage

- HeartbeatManager: 100% function coverage, 100% statement coverage, 100% branch coverage
- This extraction helps us move toward our overall goal of improved test coverage for the entire system

## Lessons for Future Refactoring

1. Maintain backward compatibility with the original interface to ensure tests continue to pass
2. Create small, focused components with clear responsibilities
3. Write comprehensive tests for each extracted component
4. Address integration points carefully to avoid breaking existing functionality
