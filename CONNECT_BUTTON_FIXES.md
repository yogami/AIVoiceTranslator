# Connect Button Functionality Fixes

This document describes the issues that were affecting the Connect button functionality and the changes made to fix them.

## Issue Description

After removing the TTS comparison functionality, the Connect button on the student interface stopped working correctly. The specific issues included:

1. References to non-existent UI elements in the event listener setup code
2. Unterminated template literals in the HTML string construction
3. Missing proper error handling for WebSocket connections

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Removed References to Comparison Features

The code contained references to UI elements that were part of the TTS comparison functionality which no longer exists:

```javascript
// BEFORE: Event listeners referenced removed UI elements
document.getElementById('refreshComparisonBtn').addEventListener('click', function() {
  refreshComparison();
});
```

These references were removed along with their associated event listeners and functions.

### 2. Fixed Unterminated Template Literals

There was an issue with unterminated template literals in the data URL construction for browser speech synthesis:

```javascript
// BEFORE: Used single quotes inside single-quoted string
const dataUrl = 'data:text/html;charset=utf-8,<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><script>window.onload=function(){try{if(\'speechSynthesis\' in window){const u=new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(decodeURIComponent("' + encodedText + '"));u.lang=decodeURIComponent("' + encodedLang + '");window.speechSynthesis.speak(u);}}catch(e){console.error("Speech error:",e);}}</script></body></html>';
```

This was fixed by using double quotes inside the single-quoted string:

```javascript
// AFTER: Using double quotes for HTML attributes
const dataUrl = 'data:text/html;charset=utf-8,<!DOCTYPE html><html><body><script>window.onload=function(){try{if("speechSynthesis" in window){const u=new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(decodeURIComponent("' + encodedText + '"));u.lang=decodeURIComponent("' + encodedLang + '");window.speechSynthesis.speak(u);}}catch(e){console.error("Speech error:",e);}}</script></body></html>';
```

### 3. Simplified WebSocket Registration

The student registration process was simplified to focus on the core functionality:

```javascript
// Registration function is now cleaner and more focused
function registerAsStudent(languageCode) {
    const message = {
        type: 'register',
        role: 'student',
        languageCode: languageCode
    };
    log(`Registering as student with language ${languageCode}`);
    socket.send(JSON.stringify(message));
}
```

## Verification

The fixes were verified using:

1. A direct WebSocket connection test (`verify-connect-button.js`) that simulates the Connect button click by sending a registration message
2. A Selenium end-to-end test in CI/CD environment (`tests/selenium/verify_connect_button.js`) that tests the actual UI interaction

Both tests confirm that:
- WebSocket connections are established properly
- Registration messages are sent correctly
- The server responds appropriately
- The UI updates to reflect the connection state

## CI/CD Integration

A GitHub Actions workflow was created to run the Selenium test in a headless Chrome environment as part of the CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that the Connect button functionality is tested automatically on every code change.

## Future Considerations

1. Consider adding more robust error handling for WebSocket connections
2. Add more detailed logging of connection status for easier troubleshooting
3. Implement retry logic for failed connection attempts
