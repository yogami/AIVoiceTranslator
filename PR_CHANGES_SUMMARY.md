# TTS Service Selection Fix - PR Summary

## Issue Fixed

The AIVoiceTranslator application was defaulting to 'openai' TTS service in several places rather than respecting the user's TTS service selection. This caused inconsistent behavior where a teacher would select 'browser' TTS but students would still receive audio generated using OpenAI.

## Changes Made

1. **Default TTS Service Changed**
   - Set default TTS service to 'browser' throughout the codebase, rather than 'openai'
   - Modified `handleRegisterMessage` method in `WebSocketServer.ts` to use 'browser' as the default
   - Updated client-side code to properly handle the default value

2. **Service Selection Propagation Fixed**
   - Fixed several instances where the code was ignoring the user-selected TTS service
   - Ensured the teacher's TTS service preference is consistently used for all student translations
   - Modified all relevant message handlers to respect the TTS service type setting

3. **Logging Improvements**
   - Added detailed logging throughout the application to help diagnose TTS service selection issues
   - Logged TTS service type in key locations where the translation and audio is generated
   - Added contextual information to logs to make debugging easier

4. **Tests Added**
   - Created a comprehensive test script (`test-tts-service-selection.cjs`) to verify TTS service selection
   - Implemented Selenium tests for CI/CD environment to verify end-to-end behavior
   - Added GitHub workflow to run TTS service selection tests automatically

## Verification

The changes have been verified through:

1. **Unit Tests**: All 5 test cases in `test-tts-service-selection.cjs` pass successfully
2. **Manual Testing**: Verified behavior with multiple browser tabs simulating teacher and student
3. **Selenium Tests**: Created end-to-end tests for CI/CD to verify the fix

## Notes for Reviewers

- Please verify the fix by testing both the teacher and student interfaces simultaneously
- Try switching between different TTS services to ensure the selection persists
- Review the logs to confirm the correct TTS service is being used throughout the flow
