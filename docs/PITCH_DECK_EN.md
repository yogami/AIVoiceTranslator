## Classroom Inclusion Assistant (ACE + Offline Gateway) — Pitch (EN)

### 1) Problem
- Beginners don’t share a language with the teacher; many native languages in one room.
- Literal translation ≠ understanding; technical/vocational terms are confusing.
- Wi‑Fi is unreliable in some schools; cloud tools fail during class.

### 2) Our Solution
- A classroom inclusion assistant (not just a translator).
- Works on any device (browser), even offline via a small classroom gateway.

### 3) What It Does
- ACE: simpler sentences, slower pace when needed, consistent technical terms from your course materials.
- Private Voice Lock: recognizes the teacher’s voice to cut noise/crosstalk.
- On‑Demand Elaboration: one‑tap explanation + short example in the student’s language.
- Offline Gateway: sub‑2s voice+captions, no cloud required.

### 4) For Teachers
- Fewer “I don’t understand” moments; live hint “simplify this” when many struggle.
- Keep the exact German terms (important for exams), with short L1 explanations.
- Runs even with poor Internet; no app installs.

### 5) For Students
- Hear/see the teacher in your language; short chunks; slow repeat if needed.
- One tap “Elaborate” to get a quick, clear example.

### 6) Setup Needed
- Small local box (Pi 5 or mini‑PC), speakers in room; student devices with a browser.
- Optional: upload a simple course glossary (or we extract from your PDF).

### 7) Pilot & Metrics
- 4–6 weeks in 2–3 classes.
- Measure: −25–40% confusion rate, −20% time‑to‑understanding,
  ≥95% term fidelity, ≥99.5% offline reliability.

### 8) Privacy
- On‑prem by default; no raw audio leaves the school in offline mode.
- Consent for voice enrollment (teacher/student); easy delete.

### 9) Call to Action
- 30‑minute on‑site demo in your class.
- Pick 1–2 courses for a short pilot; we handle setup and reporting.
