## Patentability and Filing Strategy (Germany/EU focus)

### Can this be patented?
Yes—parts of your system can be patentable in Germany/EU as a computer‑implemented invention when framed as a technical solution to a technical problem (not an algorithm “as such”). File before any public disclosure to preserve novelty (EU generally has no broad grace period).

### Candidate inventions (draft as technical solutions)
- Adaptive Comprehension Engine (ACE)
  - Real‑time pipeline that adjusts reading level, pacing, and delivery based on live comprehension signals under strict latency constraints.
  - Technical effects: reduced latency variance, improved intelligibility under noise and bandwidth limits.
- Federated accent/dialect personalization on a local gateway
  - Privacy‑preserving, on‑device adaptation for ASR/MT using per‑speaker embeddings and resource‑aware scheduling, without exporting raw audio.
  - Technical effects: lower WER and translation error while maintaining QoS and privacy.
- Curriculum‑aware term‑locking
  - Pre‑class ingestion builds a constrained translation lattice/glossary; runtime biasing enforces term fidelity with low overhead.
  - Technical effects: deterministic terminology under real‑time constraints.
- Deterministic offline m:n gateway
  - Architecture for bandwidth shaping, voice‑pack caching, and queueing to guarantee sub‑2s E2E latency for mixed devices and unstable networks.
  - Technical effects: bounded latency and reliability offline.

### Filing routes (typical)
- Germany national (DPMA) → fastest local protection; can later file EPO within 12 months.
- EPO (European Patent) → upon grant, opt for Unitary Patent coverage or validate in DE only.
- US provisional → PCT within 12 months → EPO/DE national phase at 30/31 months (if you want broad options).

### Drafting guidance (EU practice)
- Frame claims around concrete pipeline stages, network/resource control, on‑device training, and measurable technical effects.
- Prepare claim sets: method, apparatus (gateway + clients), and computer program product.
- Include dependent claims for caching strategies, adaptation thresholds, scheduling, glossary biasing, and latency bounds.

### Confidentiality & FTO
- Keep pilots under NDA until filing; avoid public demos/docs.
- Commission patentability and freedom‑to‑operate (FTO) searches (e.g., Microsoft Translator, spf.io, Wordly, KUDO, Interprefy, Agora) to reduce risk.

### Cost ranges (estimates; vary by firm/scope)
- Germany (DPMA) initial filing + attorney: ~€5,000–€12,000; to grant total ~€10,000–€20,000 over several years (incl. responses/annuities).
- EPO (European) initial to filing: ~€8,000–€15,000; to grant often ~€20,000–€40,000+ (prosecution/translation/validation/annuities).
- US provisional: ~$2,000–$5,000 (drafting); non‑provisional + prosecution: ~$8,000–$15,000; lifetime total commonly ~$20,000–$40,000.
- PCT (international phase): official + attorney typically ~$8,000–$15,000 incremental before national phase.
- Unitary Patent annuities vs national validations: budgeting depends on target states; Unitary often cheaper if many countries.

### Practical next steps
1. Keep details confidential; set up NDAs for pilots.
2. Draft an invention disclosure (problem, architecture, flows, timing budgets, technical effects, variants, diagrams).
3. Engage a European patent attorney for patentability + FTO searches.
4. File a first application (DE or EP, or US provisional) to secure a priority date; expand within 12 months.

### Claim skeleton (to brief counsel)
- Independent method claim: real‑time classroom translation pipeline with (i) live signal‑driven comprehension adaptation, (ii) curriculum term locking, (iii) on‑device accent personalization, (iv) deterministic offline QoS; producing bounded‑latency audio/captions per student.
- Independent apparatus claim: gateway device configured with caching, scheduling, and federated adaptation modules; client devices for delivery; network policy enforcing SLA offline.
- Program product claim: instructions causing the above when executed.
