## Feature Roadmap

### Purpose
Plan the next set of high‑impact features that directly help teachers and students, expressed in simple terms with clear value.

### MVP (today)
- Live speech pipeline: Teacher speaks → Student sees translation and hears audio in their own language
- Multi‑tier resilience: Works with paid, free, and offline services; always attempts to deliver audio and text
- Classroom sessions: Teacher ↔ Student connections, session lifecycle, manual vs auto delivery

### Next: High‑impact features (teacher and student value)

1) Real‑time accuracy check before broadcasting
- What: Show a quick preview of translation + pronunciation quality; one‑tap approve/send
- Value: Prevents embarrassing mistranslations; teacher keeps control

2) CEFR‑aligned learning feedback
- What: Each sentence gets a simple A1–C1 indicator and a tip (e.g., “Good for A2; use simpler verbs”)
- Value: Teacher can adjust speech level; students get content matching their level

3) Pronunciation coach for students
- What: Tap any sentence to hear it slowed; student records and gets a score with syllable hints
- Value: Immediate practice loop; builds speaking confidence

4) Personal phrasebook
- What: Students bookmark tricky phrases; auto‑build a personal phrasebook (with audio)
- Value: Better retention and revision between classes

5) “Teach once, reach many languages” view
- What: Teacher broadcast shows which languages receive which lines; simple status by language
- Value: One lesson works for mixed‑language classrooms; teacher stays informed

6) Manual/auto “moment switch”
- What: One toggle to switch between live auto‑translation and teacher‑reviewed manual mode during sensitive topics
- Value: Balance speed vs accuracy when it matters

7) Offline‑friendly mode
- What: If internet dips, keep basic transcription/translation locally (where possible) and sync later
- Value: Resilience in low‑connectivity schools

8) Topic/lesson vocabulary pack
- What: Teacher selects a topic (e.g., “weather”); key vocab is highlighted and added to a mini‑quiz
- Value: Targeted outcomes; less scatter in learning

9) Student comprehension pulse
- What: Students tap “confused/clear” during class; teacher sees a simple live meter per language group
- Value: Real‑time teaching adjustments

10) Post‑class recap with audio
- What: Auto‑generate a lesson summary per language (text + audio) and share (e.g., WhatsApp/Email)
- Value: Reinforcement at home; improves retention

11) Speed and voice personalization
- What: Students choose playback speed and a clearer voice for their language
- Value: Accessibility across ages and hearing needs

12) Safety and sensitive content alerts
- What: Gentle alerts for potentially sensitive phrasing; provide a safer alternative
- Value: Builds trust in diverse classrooms

13) Attendance and engagement tracker
- What: Simple dashboard: who connected, “confused” taps, vocab mastered
- Value: Teachers show progress; admins get measurable impact

14) Quick quiz from teacher speech
- What: Auto‑create 3–5 questions from the transcript; students answer on their phones
- Value: Instant feedback; data for next lesson

15) Private teacher notes on mis‑hears
- What: Teacher flags recurring misrecognitions (names/local terms) once; system improves next time
- Value: Fewer errors over time; feels tailored

16) Community voice pack requests
- What: If a language/accent is missing, students request it; system fetches and caches the voice
- Value: Inclusive language coverage that scales

### Suggested Phasing
- Phase 1 (2–4 weeks): Real‑time accuracy preview; manual/auto switch; post‑class recap; speed/voice controls
- Phase 2 (4–8 weeks): Pronunciation coach; CEFR feedback; topic vocab + mini‑quiz; comprehension pulse
- Phase 3 (8–12 weeks): Attendance/engagement dashboard; safety alerts; teacher notes for mis‑hears; community voice requests

### Why this is hard to copy (defensibility)
- Reliability moat: Multi‑tier fallbacks, voice caching, audio normalization, and session orchestration
- Pedagogy moat: CEFR feedback, pronunciation scoring, targeted vocab and quizzes
- Coverage moat: On‑demand voices for the long tail of languages and dialects
