## Feature Roadmap

### Purpose
Plan the next set of high‑impact features that directly help teachers and students, expressed in simple terms with clear value.

### MVP (today)
- Live speech pipeline: Teacher speaks → Student sees translation and hears audio in their own language
- Multi‑tier resilience: Works with paid, free, and offline services; always attempts to deliver audio and text
- Classroom sessions: Teacher ↔ Student connections, session lifecycle, manual vs auto delivery

### Next: Differentiated features (our wedge in live, mixed‑language classrooms)

0) On‑Demand Elaboration (Micro‑Tutoring)  ← moved to top
- What: Students tap “Elaborate” to get a brief, simpler explanation and one example for the last sentence; teacher can pin to all.
- Value: Converts translation into understanding in the moment; measurable drop in miscomprehension.

1) Class glossary loop
- What: One‑tap “correct translation” and “fix pronunciation”; persists for the rest of class and future lessons
- Value: Classroom‑specific accuracy that compounds; fewer repeated errors

2) Multi‑language broadcast health panel
- What: Live tiles for each target language: delivered/queued/failed with quick resend
- Value: Operates at classroom scale; confidence when teaching many languages at once

3) Offline/campus mode (Gateway SLA)
- What: Pre‑baked voice + topic packs; runs without cloud; background sync later
- Value: Works in low‑connectivity schools and privacy‑sensitive deployments

4) WhatsApp recap
- What: End‑of‑class summary per language (text + audio) that shares without app installs
- Value: Reinforcement at home; immediate utility for families

5) Privacy and audit controls
- What: “No cloud” switch, redaction, do‑not‑learn flags, exportable audit for admins
- Value: Trust, compliance, and deployability in public institutions

6) Community voice requests
- What: Students request missing voices/accents; admin approves; system fetches and caches automatically
- Value: Long‑tail coverage that improves with each classroom

### Suggested Phasing
- Phase 1 (2–4 weeks): On‑Demand Elaboration (MVP); Class glossary loop; privacy and audit controls (MVP subset)
- Phase 2 (4–8 weeks): Multi‑language broadcast health panel; Offline/campus mode (core); WhatsApp recap
- Phase 3 (8–12 weeks): Private Voice Lock (teacher‑only); Community voice requests; admin reporting and exports

### Why this is hard to copy (defensibility)
- Reliability moat: Multi‑tier fallbacks, voice caching, audio normalization, and session orchestration
- Pedagogy moat in live settings: Teacher approval preview, per‑class lexicon, pronunciation fixes that persist
- Coverage moat: On‑demand voices for the long tail of languages and dialects; community‑driven expansion

### Differentiation & GTM
- Wedge vs incumbents: Real‑time mixed‑language classrooms, long‑tail TTS/STT coverage, privacy/offline options, low‑cost reliability
- Go‑to‑market: German VHS/Integrationskurse, refugee welcome classes, municipal clinics/triage desks, NGOs; priced per classroom device/license
- 60‑second demo: Teacher speaks; tiles show EN/AR/UKR; approve/send; a mistranslation is corrected and sticks; Wi‑Fi drops → offline mode; WhatsApp recap sent
