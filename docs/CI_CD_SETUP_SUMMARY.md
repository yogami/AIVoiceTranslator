- **Production**: Auto-deploy on `main` branch pushes
- **Database Migrations**: Automatic migration execution
- **Health Checks**: Smoke tests and health endpoint verification
- **Rollback**: Automatic rollback on deployment failures

## 🎮 Quick Start Guide

### 1. First-Time Setup
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Run the setup script
./scripts/setup-railway.sh

# Or set up manually following DEPLOYMENT.md
```

### 2. Configure GitHub Secrets
Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets → Actions and add:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
RAILWAY_TOKEN_STAGING=your-railway-staging-token
RAILWAY_TOKEN_PRODUCTION=your-railway-production-token
RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID_STAGING=your-staging-service-id
RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID_PRODUCTION=your-production-service-id
```

### 3. Deploy to Production
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
git checkout develop
git add .
git commit -m "feat: ready for staging deployment"
git push origin develop

# Deploy to production
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
```

## 🔍 Health Check Endpoints

Your app includes these health endpoints that the CI/CD pipeline uses:

- **`/api/health`** - Returns JSON with server status, database connectivity, and session counts
- **`/api/test`** - Simple API connectivity test endpoint
- **`/api/diagnostics`** - Comprehensive system diagnostics

## 📊 Pipeline Monitoring

### GitHub Actions Dashboard
- View pipeline runs: `https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/actions`
- Monitor test results, deployment status, and error logs
- Download artifacts for debugging

### Railway Dashboard
- Monitor deployment status and logs
- Check resource usage and performance metrics
- View environment variables and service configuration

## 🎯 Branch Strategy

### `main` Branch
- **Triggers**: Production deployment
- **Tests**: All test suites must pass
- **Deployment**: Automatic to `https://aivoicetranslator.railway.app`

### `develop` Branch
- **Triggers**: Staging deployment
- **Tests**: All test suites must pass
- **Deployment**: Automatic to `https://aivoicetranslator-staging.railway.app`

### Feature Branches
- **Triggers**: Test runs only (no deployment)
- **Tests**: All test suites run for PR validation

## 🔧 Manual Deployment Commands

### Local Development
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Test locally
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration

# Start production server
npm start
```

### Railway Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Check deployment health
npm run deploy:check
```

## 📈 Cost Estimation

### Railway Costs (Monthly)
- **Hobby Plan**: $5/month per service
- **Production + Staging**: ~$10/month total
- **Database**: Included in service cost
- **Bandwidth**: 100GB included

### GitHub Actions (Free Tier)
- **2,000 minutes/month** included
- **Current pipeline**: ~15 minutes per run
- **Estimated usage**: ~120 runs/month within free tier

## 🛡️ Security Features
