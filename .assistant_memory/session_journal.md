## 2025-04-26 - Conversation #1

### Context
- Initial session focused on confirming the Connect button fix works properly
- WebSocket connection testing was verified using direct testing approach
- CI/CD workflows have been configured for GitHub Actions

### Key Technical Decisions
- Used direct WebSocket testing over browser-based testing due to library dependency issues
- Confirmed template literals are properly closed in the student interface HTML
- Set up persistent memory system for maintaining context between sessions

### User Experience Notes
- User expressed need for persistent memory to allow for smoother workflow
- Important to back up code to GitHub for version control and CI/CD
- Need to maintain context across conversations for more efficient collaboration

## 2025-04-26 - Conversation #2

### Context
- User requested improvement to the AI assistant's ability to remember between sessions
- Initial memory system established with file-based storage and PostgreSQL database
- Memory files include project configuration, GitHub credentials, conversation history

### Key Technical Decisions
- Created JSON files for storing configuration and credentials
- Used markdown files for storing conversation history and session journal
- Implemented ES module-compatible memory helper script
- Set up PostgreSQL database for potential future memory enhancements

### User Experience Notes
- Session-to-session memory is critical for pair programming efficiency
- Development workflow requires GitHub integration
- Memory system should be separate from the main application code
