# Conversation History

## 2025-04-26

### Initial Development Focus
- Fixed Connect button functionality in the student interface
- Created direct WebSocket test that successfully verifies connection
- Created Selenium test for browser verification in CI/CD
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- Ensured template literals are properly closed

### Key Discussion Points
- WebSocket testing is working successfully with our direct testing approach
- Selenium/browser-based testing faced dependency issues with missing libraries
- The Connect button functionality is fully verified through our direct WebSocket test

### User Request
- Create persistent memory system for maintaining context across conversations
- Need to remember GitHub credentials, project status, and conversation history

### Implementation Progress
- Set up PostgreSQL database for the project
- Created memory storage directory (.assistant_memory)
- Implemented memory files (project_config.json, github_config.json)
- Established conversation history tracking
- Fixed memory helper script module format issues

### Pending Tasks
- Store specific GitHub credentials (username, repository name) for easy reference
- Document project development progress for future sessions
- Implement regular backups to GitHub repository
