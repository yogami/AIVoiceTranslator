# Reliable Testing Alternatives for WebSocket Features

## Current Issue with Selenium Tests

We've found that Selenium tests of WebSocket functionality are unreliable in CI/CD environments, particularly in GitHub Actions. The tests continue to fail despite multiple fix attempts.

## Recommended Alternative Testing Approaches

### 1. Direct WebSocket Tests

We created two direct WebSocket test pages that have proven to be much more reliable:

- `client/public/bare-websocket-test.html` - A minimal test that focuses only on WebSocket connectivity
- `client/public/direct-websocket-test.html` - A slightly more detailed test with proper messaging handling

These can be integrated into a testing framework like Jest without requiring browser automation.

### 2. Puppeteer for Headless Testing

For UI-dependent tests, Puppeteer is a more reliable alternative to Selenium for testing in headless environments. It has better control over the Chrome browser and provides more consistent results in CI environments.

Example script locations:
- `verify-connect-functionality.js` - Shows how to use Puppeteer for testing the Connect button

### 3. Jest with JSDOM

For component-level tests, Jest with JSDOM can mock WebSocket functionality and verify that the client-side code behaves as expected.

### 4. Direct Node.js WebSocket Tests

We've created reliable test scripts that directly test WebSocket communication without a browser:

- `verify-connect-button-direct.js` - Tests WebSocket connection directly from Node.js
- `test-websocket-client.ts` - TypeScript implementation of WebSocket client tests

## How to Choose a Testing Approach

1. **For API/Protocol Testing**: Use direct WebSocket tests with Node.js
2. **For UI Integration**: Use Puppeteer in headless mode
3. **For Component Tests**: Use Jest with JSDOM

## Implementation Plans

1. Replace Selenium WebSocket tests with direct WebSocket tests
2. Set up Puppeteer for critical UI flows
3. Create Jest tests for component-level functionality

This approach will provide better test reliability, faster test execution, and clearer failure messages when issues occur.
