# Connect Button and OpenAI TTS Fixes

## Issue 1: Connect Button Not Working

### Root Cause:
The Connect button issue was introduced during the fix for browser WebSpeech autoplay issues. The `registerAsStudent` function was modified in a way that broke the student registration process.

### Solution:
1. Restored the working version of the `registerAsStudent` function from a backup
2. Returned to using the `isConnected` flag for connection state checking instead of manual socket readyState checks
3. Simplified the registration message structure to match the original working implementation

## Issue 2: OpenAI TTS Not Auto-Playing

### Root Cause:
The OpenAI TTS audio was being generated correctly on the server, but the client-side code wasn't properly auto-playing it when received.

### Solution:
1. Added a specific auto-play functionality for the OpenAI TTS service type
2. Added a small delay (300ms) to ensure audio is loaded before attempting to play
3. Added proper error handling and visual feedback when auto-playing OpenAI audio

### Code Changes:
```javascript
// Auto-play for OpenAI TTS when that service is selected
if (ttsServiceType === 'openai') {
    log('Auto-playing OpenAI TTS audio');
    // Slight delay to make sure audio is loaded
    setTimeout(() => {
        audio.play().catch(err => {
            log('Error auto-playing OpenAI audio: ' + err.message);
            showError('Auto-play failed: ' + err.message);
        });
        
        // Visual feedback during playback
        playButton.style.backgroundColor = '#e74c3c';
        playButton.innerHTML = '<span class="play-icon">ðŸ”Š</span> Playing OpenAI audio...';
    }, 300);
    showSuccess('Playing OpenAI translation audio');
} else {
    showSuccess('Server-generated audio ready to play');
}
```

### Files Modified:

## Testing

Both issues have been verified fixed by:
1. Testing the Connect button functionality in the student interface
2. Verifying that OpenAI TTS auto-plays audio when messages are received

## Lesson Learned

When fixing one issue (WebSpeech autoplay), we inadvertently broke another feature (Connect button). In the future, we should:

1. Make more focused, smaller changes
2. Have comprehensive test coverage for all critical features
3. Set up full end-to-end tests that verify all critical user flows
4. Create backups before making significant changes to critical code
