## Product Pitch

### Problem
Newly arrived immigrant and refugee students often share no common language with their teachers. In the first months, lessons become survival—students can’t follow spoken instruction, teachers can’t gauge comprehension, and low‑connectivity schools can’t rely on cloud tools. Generic “event translators” return words, not understanding: they miss curriculum terms, stumble on local accents, and fail when Wi‑Fi does.

### Solution (what and how)
AIVoiceTranslator is a classroom translator purpose‑built for true beginners with no shared language. Any device joins via QR to a many‑to‑many voice + captions session. Our Adaptive Comprehension Engine (ACE) simplifies phrasing, slows pace, and auto read‑aloud when students struggle; a teacher HUD nudges “simplify this” in real time. A small in‑class gateway guarantees sub‑2s translations offline, learns local accents privately to boost accuracy each week, and locks key syllabus terms so academic vocabulary stays consistent (e.g., “photosynthesis” is always correct). Privacy is default: adaptation happens on‑prem; schools control data.

### Why we’re different
- From translation to understanding: ACE adapts difficulty, pacing, and delivery for beginners.
- Gets better every class: local accent/dialect personalization and class glossaries on the gateway.
- Curriculum‑aware: term‑locking ensures accurate, consistent academic vocabulary.
- Guaranteed classroom reliability: sub‑2s latency, works offline; no app installs.
- Measurable impact: comprehension/participation trends for equity reporting and grants.

### Impact (students and teachers)
- Students: simpler sentences, slower read‑aloud, accurate lesson terms, and reliable access—even with bad internet.
- Teachers: live “comprehension radar,” consistent terminology from your slides, privacy‑first operation, quick equity reports.

### Proof targets (pilot KPIs)
- −25–40% “confused/need‑slower” signals and −20% time‑to‑understanding within 4 weeks.
- ≥99.5% offline reliability with P50 < 2s, P95 < 3.5s latency.
- Fewer teacher corrections; higher syllabus term fidelity.

### Rollout & Ask
- Fund pilots in newcomer/refugee programs across two districts.
- We’ll deliver an offline gateway, enable ACE + curriculum packs, and report comprehension, reliability, and cost per student within one term.
