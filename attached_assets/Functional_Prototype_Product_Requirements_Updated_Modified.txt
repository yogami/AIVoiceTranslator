            Functional Prototype Product Requirements Document

This updated version includes both the traditional STT -> Translation -> TTS pipeline and a new
direct speech-to-speech translation approach using OpenAI's Realtime API.
New Section: Direct Speech-to-Speech Translation with OpenAI Realtime API
OpenAI's Realtime API enables direct audio-to-audio translation via streaming. This updated
architecture provides:

- Reduced latency
- Improved prosody and natural speech
- Simpler system design

It replaces the traditional STT -> Translation -> TTS pipeline with a unified endpoint that handles all
three stages internally.
