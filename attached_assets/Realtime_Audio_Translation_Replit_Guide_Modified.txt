                   Realtime Audio-to-Audio Translation on Replit

Project: Real-Time Audio-to-Audio Translation
Platform: Replit
Use Case: Translate spoken input from a teacher into spoken output in another language - in real
time - using OpenAI's real-time streaming API.

Objective:
Implement a real-time streaming web app on Replit that:
- Captures live microphone input in the browser
- Streams audio to OpenAI's real-time speech translation API
- Receives translated audio and plays it back to the user (or to connected students)

Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, JavaScript, Web Audio API
Backend: Node.js + ws for WebSocket proxy
Hosting: Replit (always-on repl)
Streaming API: OpenAI Real-Time Audio API

Architecture Overview:
Mic Input in Browser
 ->
WebSocket Connection -> Node.js Backend on Replit
 ->
OpenAI Real-Time Streaming API
 ->
Translated Audio Response -> Browser Playback

Required APIs:
OpenAI Real-Time Translation (Streaming)

Replit Implementation:
1. Fork & Setup
Create a new Node.js Replit project. Install: npm install express ws axios dotenv
Create .env with your OpenAI key.

2. Backend (Node.js WebSocket Proxy)
index.js - sets up WebSocket relay between browser and OpenAI's API.

3. Frontend (Mic Capture & Playback)
index.html + app.js - captures mic audio, streams to backend, receives translated speech, and plays
it.

Goals & KPIs:
Latency: < 2 seconds
Audio quality: 4.5 / 5
Translation accuracy: 90%+
Uptime: 24/7 on Replit

Testing Tips:
- Use Chrome
- Use headphones
- Adjust buffer size for latency tuning

Security & Deployment:
- Replit provides HTTPS/WSS
- Store OPENAI_API_KEY in Secrets
- Use console.log() for debugging
