Proof of Concept: Rapid Prototype for AIVoiceTranslator

Objective:

Develop a fully functional voice translation prototype for 1 teacher and 3 students in a live classroom
environment. This PoC should demonstrate real-time translation from speech-to-speech in multiple
languages with minimal latency and maximum clarity.

Target Setup

- Participants: 1 teacher (microphone input), 3 students (each receiving different language audio)
- Languages: English (input), Spanish, German, French (outputs)

Tech Stack (Sophisticated Tools for Rapid Prototyping)

| Component | Tool | Reason |
|----------|------|--------|
| Audio Ingestion | WebRTC / MediaRecorder API | For low-latency browser-based audio capture |
| Speech-to-Text (STT) | Deepgram (API) | Ultra-low latency, high accuracy |
| Fallback STT | OpenAI Whisper (API) | Superior multilingual support, robust in noisy settings |
| Translation | OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo API | High quality, real-time language translation |
| Text-to-Speech (TTS) | ElevenLabs / OpenAI TTS | Natural voice output, multiple languages |
| Streaming Server | Node.js + WebSocket | Real-time audio distribution to clients |
| Frontend | React (Next.js or Vite) | Fast, modular UI for language selection and playback |
| Deployment | Render / Vercel (Frontend), Railway / Fly.io (Backend) | Rapid CI/CD, low overhead, free/cheap tier for MVP |

Implementation Steps
Step 1: Audio Capture from Teacher

- Use WebRTC or MediaRecorder API in a React frontend.
- Stream audio in 12 sec chunks via WebSocket to backend server.

Step 2: STT Integration (Primary)

- Integrate Deepgram Real-time Streaming API on backend (Node.js).
- Configure Deepgram's Nova-3 model with "enhanced" tier for best accuracy.
- WebSocket stream from frontend Deepgram transcript.

Step 3: STT Fallback

- If Deepgram fails or latency spikes, fallback to OpenAI Whisper API.
- Use audio buffering and Whisper API in async mode.
- Select model: whisper-large for accuracy.

Step 4: Translation Pipeline

- Send transcript to OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo API.
- Use system prompt to ensure translation accuracy & tone.
- Cache repeated phrases to reduce token cost.

Step 5: TTS Generation

- Use ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS API.
- Generate voice for each target language.
- Save as small .mp3 files or stream directly (preferred).

Step 6: Audio Streaming to Students

- Implement WebSocket-based audio push per language.
- React client subscribes to desired language channel.
- Add play/pause buttons and fallback download link.

Deployment & Execution

Backend:

- Use Railway.app or Fly.io to deploy the Node.js backend.
- Secure environment variables (API keys for Deepgram, OpenAI, TTS).
- Auto-scale enabled for 35 concurrent users.

Frontend:

- Deploy React frontend to Vercel or Render.
- Enable HTTPS for secure audio streams.
- Minimal UI with:
 - Mic toggle (teacher)
 - Language select (students)
 - Live status & audio playback

Metrics to Validate

- Latency: Speech to playback < 2 seconds
- Accuracy: > 90% transcript + translation match
- Clarity: TTS quality rated > 4.5/5
- Throughput: System handles 3 concurrent streams with no delay

Key Notes

- Ensure caching is implemented at both translation & TTS layers.
- Log token usage and errors for feedback loop.
- Prioritize latency over full transcript integrity.
- PoC will inform architecture for larger 25+ student pilot.
