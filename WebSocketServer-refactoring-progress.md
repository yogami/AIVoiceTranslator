# WebSocketServer Refactoring Progress

## Components Successfully Refactored

### 1. HeartbeatManager

The HeartbeatManager is responsible for maintaining WebSocket connection health through a ping/pong mechanism:

- **Status**: ✅ Complete with passing tests 
- **Test Coverage**: 100% function, statement, and branch coverage
- **Implementation**: Provides clean API for managing connection health with clear error handling
- **Core Features**:
  - Connection health monitoring via ping/pong
  - Inactive connection termination
  - Clean error handling for ping failures

### 2. WebSocketClientManager

The WebSocketClientManager provides a clean API for tracking and querying WebSocket clients:

- **Status**: ✅ Complete with passing tests
- **Test Coverage**: High coverage across all client management functionality
- **Implementation**: Replaces multiple Maps with a unified client tracking system
- **Core Features**:
  - Client registration and removal
  - Role and language management
  - Client settings storage
  - Filtering clients by role and language
  - Specialized methods for teacher/student access

## Remaining Work

While we've made good progress extracting these components, we still need to:

1. Create a WebSocketMessageRouter for handling message routing based on type
2. Create specialized message handlers for specific message types
3. Simplify the main WebSocketServer class by leveraging these extracted components
4. Address integration test failures related to translation and audio processing

## Next Steps

Our recommended approach for continued refactoring:

1. Create the WebSocketMessageRouter component
2. Add specialized message handlers starting with registration and basic messages
3. Address more complex handlers for translation and audio processing
4. Finally, integrate all components into a simplified WebSocketServer class

## Testing Strategy

For each component, we should:

1. Write comprehensive unit tests targeting high code coverage
2. Ensure proper error handling is tested
3. Maintain integration test compatibility to avoid breaking existing functionality
