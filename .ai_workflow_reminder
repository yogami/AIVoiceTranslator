# AI Workflow Reminder for AIVoiceTranslator Project

## Core Process (TDD)
1. Write tests first
2. Implement code to pass tests
3. Refactor while maintaining test passing
4. Update testing pyramid & metrics
5. Update CI/CD configuration
6. Update documentation
7. Manual verification

## Quality Standards to Maintain
- Test Coverage: >90% 
- Cyclomatic Complexity: ≤3
- No critical code smells
- Function Length: <50 lines
- Nesting Depth: ≤3 levels
- Code Duplication: <5%

## Scripts to Use
- Test runners in tests/ directory
- CI/CD trigger for GitHub Actions
- Metrics update via test-metrics-api.js

## Dashboard Updates
- Always update the metrics dashboard after changes
- Verify dashboard data accurately reflects code state
